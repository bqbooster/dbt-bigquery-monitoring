## dbt-bigquery-monitoring v0.23.1 - October 01, 2025

### Fixes


  - Handle trailing dbt metadata comment  ([#150](https://github.com/bqbooster/dbt-bigquery-monitoring/issues/150))

  - Add new model for BigQuery audit logs and update references in existing model ([#144](https://github.com/bqbooster/dbt-bigquery-monitoring/issues/144))

### Under the Hood


  - flatten models that were using jobs_by_project_with_cost instead jobs_with_cost
